# Where in the Universe are you?

Have you ever wondered where you'd currently be in the Universe if you were launched directly upwards from your birth place at the time you were born? 

Well at .Astronomy 9 in Cape Town we hacked this project together so you can find out!

Python back end using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [astropy](http://www.astropy.org/) - now hosted at: https://where-in-the-universe.herokuapp.com/
